# Interaction Stripper

Interaction Stripper is a plugin for Penpot that enables bulk removal of interactions across selected boards.
Easily copy a flow and strip its superfluous interactions for a clearer journey demonstration.

![Example action: Any interactions that transition outside the selection from any objects.](./docs/media/interaction_stripper_image-2.png)

Affected interactions are filterable; Limit to those of **particular journeys**, those that interact with **overlays**, or those using a **certain trigger**, and **more**.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 10px; margin-bottom: 3em;">
  <img src="./docs/media/interaction_stripper_image-1.png" alt="Example action: Clicks that transition outside the selection from components." style="width: 50%;">

</div>
